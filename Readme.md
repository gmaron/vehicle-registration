# Vehicle Registration Project

It's a project of [Ripio's](https://www.ripio.com/es/) course explaining how ICO's and tokens works.

The technologies used are:

* ```Solidity``` as language program
* ```Remix``` as IDE and interface to deploy the smart contracts in the Ropsten Test net in the ETH Blockchain through Metamask as wallet

## Considerations

For a more comfortable implementation I prefered to use ```VisualStudioCode``` with Solidity plugin and copy the code into Remix.

The CarMarket contract was based on the [Cryptopunks'](https://github.com/larvalabs/cryptopunks) contracts.
